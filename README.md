Building for Production
To create a production-ready build of the application:

Bash

npm run build
# or if you use Yarn:
# yarn build
This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hash codes.

Known Limitations or Features Not Implemented

Backend Integration: This is purely a front-end UI. It currently lacks a persistent backend for storing product data, orders, or user authentication. Data is typically mock data or managed client-side for demonstration.
Database Connectivity: No direct database connection is implemented.
Payment Gateway Integration: No real-time payment processing is included.
User Management/Roles: Does not include features for different user roles (e.g., cashier, manager).
Advanced Reporting: Lacks comprehensive sales reporting or analytics.
Offline Support: No explicit offline capabilities or PWA features.
Responsiveness for all devices: While designed to be responsive, it might require further optimization for very specific screen sizes or orientations.
